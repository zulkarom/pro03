			<p>JEB follows the&nbsp;<a href="https://publicationethics.org/">Committee on Publication Ethics</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(COPE)&#39;s Code of Conduct for the following policy domains:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Editorial Principles </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accountability and responsibility for journal content </strong></em></p>

<p>The editors of the journal are responsible for the policies and procedures in ensuring the quality and integrity of the articles published.</p>

<p><strong><em>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Editorial independence and integrity </em></strong></p>

<p>The responsibility of our editors is to make fair and unbiased decisions in order to uphold the principle of editorial independence and integrity.</p>

<p style="margin-left:36.0pt;"><em>2.1 Separating decision-making from commercial considerations</em></p>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;margin-left:100px">
	<li>Our editors make decisions on academic merit and take full responsibility for their decisions.</li>
	<li>Since our journal is not published for commercial purposes (i.e. JEB does not collect any fees from any parties), separating decision-making from commercial considerations is a non-issue.</li>
	<li>Any articles submitted by academician from Universiti Malaysia Kelantan undergo the same rigorous quality control by sending the articles to two external reviewers.</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin-left:36.0pt;"><em>2.2 Editors&rsquo; relationship to the journal publisher or owner </em></p>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;margin-left:100px">
	<li>Each editor has an appointment letter setting out the terms and conditions of their appointment with our journal.</li>
	<li>JEB&rsquo;s publisher does not have any role in decisions on content for commercial or political reasons. The publisher also does not dismiss an editor because of any journal content unless there was gross editorial misconduct, or an independent investigation has concluded that the editor&rsquo;s decision to publish was against the journal&rsquo;s scholarly mission.</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin-left:36.0pt;"><em>2.3 Journal metrics and decision-making </em></p>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;margin-left:100px">
	<li>The journal does not make any attempt to artificially increase any journal metric or demand that references to that journal&rsquo;s articles are included except for genuine scholarly reasons. In other words, the articles are reviewed on purely scholarly grounds, and that the author(s) is not pressured to cite specific publications for non-scholarly reasons</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Editorial confidentiality </em></strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:36.0pt;"><em>3.1 Authors&rsquo; material </em></p>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;margin-left:100px">
	<li>The journal protects the confidentiality of the author(s)&rsquo; material and reminds reviewers to do the same and to not share submitted articles with the editors of other journals, unless with the author(s)&rsquo; full agreement or in cases of alleged misconduct.</li>
	<li>Our web-based system does not allow any unauthorised access.</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin-left:36.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Editorial decision-making </em></strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:36.0pt;"><em>7.1 Editorial and journal processes </em></p>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;margin-left:100px">
	<li value="1"><strong>Initiall Assessment</strong>: The Managing Editor or an Associate Editor will first evaluate similarities (using Turnitin), the scope of the manuscript (how it fits with JEB&rsquo;s scope), and lastly, whether the manuscript has sufficient merit to send to reviewers for further review. If the manuscript does not reach the minimum standard, the article will be desk rejected and returned to the author(s) with an explanation of the editors&rsquo; reasoning.&nbsp;</li>

	<li value="2"><strong>Peer Review Details: </strong>If a manuscript passes the initial screening, the Managing Editor and/or Associate Editor will recruit reviewers to assess the merits of the manuscript. Upon the receipt of the report from the reviews, the Managing Editor and/or Associate Editor will provide a recommendation to the Editor-in-Chief who will finally decide whether the article should be accepted, whether requiring minor corrections, major correction or rejection.</li>
	<li value="3"><strong>Notification</strong>: E-mail notification will be sent to the corresponding author, announcing that a decision has been made. The possible decisions are Reject, Major Revision, Minor Revision, and Accept.</li>
	<li value="4"><strong>Revisions</strong>: Revisions, if suggested, have to be undertaken within a given time. A manuscript that is not revised within one year may be reclassified as &quot;withdrawn,&quot; and revisions submitted after the one-year mark may be treated as new submissions. All revisions should be accompanied by a separate &quot;Response to Reviewers&quot; document, which provides a summary of the major changes made to the document and a point-by-point description of whether and how the issues raised by the reviewers and editors have been addressed.</li>
	<li value="5"><strong>Rejection</strong>: As a rule, JEB does not invite resubmissions of rejected manuscripts. If a submitted manuscript is based on an article previously rejected by the Journal, it is the responsibility of the author(s) to reveal this and to state clearly why resubmission is justified. Failure to do this may be grounds for rejection.</li>
	<li value="6"><strong>After Acceptance - Final Submission</strong>: If the article is conditionally accepted for publication, the corresponding author(s) will be requested to submit the final version of the manuscript using the JEB Template.</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin-left:36.0pt;"><em>7.2 Editorial conflicts of interest </em></p>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;margin-left:100px">
	<li>The editors and the author(s) from Universiti Malaysia Kelantan are not involved in the decision about the articles submitted.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Any articles submitted by editors and author(s) from Universiti Malaysia Kelantan undergo the same rigorous quality control by sending the articles to two external reviewers.</li>
